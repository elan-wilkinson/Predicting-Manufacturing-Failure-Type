# Prediction of Failure and Failure Type from Machine Production Data
Team 4 AAI-510 Machine learning: Fundamentals and Applications: Machine Predictive Maintenance - Prediction of Failure and Failure Type utilizing synthetic manufacturing dataset.


### Project Status: Active


## Project Intro/Objective
Using the available machine production data, we will predict likely future failure and type. The data available is comprised of temperature readings, readings from and measurement data from the equipment, product quality variants, failure states, and failure types. Multiple modeling approaches will be evaluated, with a particular emphasis on leveraging ensemble methods.

## Project Description
This project uses the dataset found at 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification
comprised of synthetically generated data of machining data, with labels indicating failure status, failure type, manufactured item details, and readings from the production equipment.
Features included in the dataset:
- UDI
- Product ID
- Product Type
- Air Temperature
- Process Temperature
- Rotation Speed
- Torque
- Tool Wear 
- Failure Status
- Failure 

This project will demonstrate the feasibility of predictive data on likelihood of upcoming future failure and type of failure. Knowledge of upcoming failures allows
those managing production environments to deal with challenges in a proactive rather than a reactive manner. Avoiding failures through targeted maintenance once a potential upcoming failure
is indicated allows the manufacturing environment to avoid costly downtime and work stoppage.
